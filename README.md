## Results: A senario
In the following we'll walk through a senario case for using the interface:

1. The first step is to upload the dataset file, the program will read it and print main measurements for Social Network, the result as follows in the followin picture.

2. In the second tab in the interface there is a choice to plot the social network, as we can see in the following image.

3. In the third tab we can find wiether each of the algorithms for detecting communities is recommended or not according to the value of modularity measurments. The recommendation results are shown as in the followung photo.

4. In the forth tab, a user can choose and apply an algorithm to detect the communities in the social network. Then the interface will show the number of communities and details about the nodes as shown in the following picture.

5. In the fift tab a user can compare between the results of two detecting-communities algorithms. The result is as shown in the following picture.

6. In the last tab, the user can detect the main influencer in the social network. The result is as shown in the following picture.
